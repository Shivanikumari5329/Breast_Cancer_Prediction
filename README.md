# Breast_Cancer_Prediction

Breast Cancer Prediction is a classification task aimed at predicting the diagnosis of a breast mass as either malignant(cancerous) or benign(non-cancerous). This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of breast cancer based on diagnostic data.

This dataset contains features derived from images of breast tissue samples, which include:
1. Radius: Mean of distances from the center to points on the perimeter.
2. Texture: Standard deviation of gray-scale values.
3. Perimeter: Perimeter of the tumor.
4. Area: Area of the tumor.
5. Smoothness: Local variation in radius lengths.
6. Compactness: Perimeter^2 / area - 1.0.
7. Concavity: Severity of concave portions of the contour.
8. Concave points: Number of concave portions of the contour.
9. Symmetry: Symmetry of the tumor.
10. Fractal dimension: "coastline approximation" - 1.

These features provide quantitative measurements that can be used to assess the characteristics of cell nuclei and aid in distinguishing between malignant and benign breast masses. By training a machine learning model on this dataset, it is possible to develop a predictive model that can assist in the early detection and diagnosis of breast cancer.
